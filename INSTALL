Installation is standard as for any Perl module. If you downloaded the
compressed tar file, uncompress and untar the file with the following
commands:

 gzip < perlcyc-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a directory called perlcyc in your current
directory. To install the program, type

 make
 make install

The program should now be available in all your Perl programs. 'make
install' may require root access or access through sudo. For the
latter case, type

 sudo make install

Which will prompt you for your password.
